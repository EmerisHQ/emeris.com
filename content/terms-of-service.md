## 2. Services

1.  **Emeris**. You may only utilize Emeris by connecting your virtual currency wallet.  The Emeris dashboard works with third-party web browser and mobile extensions, such as Keplr, to allow you to track and monitor a portfolio of Cryptocurrency Assets as well as access and interact with certain supported decentralized protocols and decentralized applications (collectively “dapps”). Tendermint does not control these protocols, dapps or associated modules that allow users to exchange cryptocurrency assets.  
Using the protocols, dapps or associated modules accessible by the Emeris dashboard may require that you pay a fee. You acknowledge and agree that Tendermint has no control over any transactions over the Cosmos blockchain, or any other blockchains, or methods of payment of any transactions or any actual payments of transactions. Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of the applicable cryptocurrency tokens stored at your protocol-compatible wallet address to complete any transaction on the Site.

Your use of a third-party site may be governed by the terms and conditions of that third-party site.
