title: When will more chains be supported?
tags: 
  - getting-start

To ensure a stable connection and performance expectations, not every chain that is connected via IBC to the Cosmos Hub will be supported immediately at Emeris Beta launch. Only when the team will be sure that the relayers of that hub are up and stable, the chain will be integrated on Emeris.
