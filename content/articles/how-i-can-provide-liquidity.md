In order to provide liquidity, you will need to have both sides of the pair.

If you want to provide liquidity in the [REGEN:ATOM pool](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/22) you will need to have some $ATOM and some $REGEN, to provide liquidity in the [REGEN:OSMO pool](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/42) you will need both $OSMO and $REGEN, and so on.

Remember that when we talk about percentage we are referring to the value (ie 10 $ each) and not the number of the tokens.
