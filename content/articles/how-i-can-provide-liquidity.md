In order to provide liquidity, you will need to have both sides of the pair.

If you want to provide liquidity in the [REGEN:ATOM pool](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/22) pool you will need to have some $ATOM and some $REGEN, to provide liquidity in the [REGEN:OSMO pool](https://app.osmosis.zone/pool/42) pool you will need both $OSMO and $REGEN, and so on.

Remember that when we talk about percentage we are referring to the value (i.e. $10 each) and not the number of the tokens.

To add liquidity to a given pool, go to the [**pools**] section, click on the pool you wish to add tokens to, select [**Add Liquidity**] on the right (Equity section) and indicate the desired amount of tokens. 
Once the amount of one of the two tokens is indicated, the other will automatically be filled by the system.

Note: 
*If the tokens are not in the Cosmos Hub, Emeris will first perform an interchain transaction to bring the tokens into the hub and then add the tokens to the pool.*
