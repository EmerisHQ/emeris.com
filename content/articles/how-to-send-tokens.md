*You have two options:*

*The first one will send tokens to addresses outside your account, the second one will move tokens from one address to another in the account you are currently using [ the one linked via Keplr wallet].*

Note:

* **If you want to receive mainnet tokens into your account via Emeris:** 
In the upper-right-hand corner, click on [Receive], select the token you want to deposit and you will be able to view the QR code/public address needed to complete the transaction.
The deposit is available only via mainnet (i.e. ATOM to Cosmos Hub, AKT to Akashnet, etc.)

* **It is strongly recommended that you keep enough tokens [available] to cover at least 2–3 transactions per mainnet.**
Transaction costs should be around $0.04–0.18.
