The first one will send tokens to addresses outside your account, the second one will move tokens from one address to another in the account you are currently using and linked to Keplr wallet.

[**Send to Address**] 
Enter the address to which you want to send your tokens, keep in mind to complete the memo field if the recipient is an exchange.
After checking that the data is accurate, check the box and click [continue].
Choose the type of tokens you want to send and write down the number.
Click [continue].
Select [confirm and continue] and the [approve] in the Keplr pop-up
