  bio: Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.

When you stake ATOM, the ATOM are effectively locked up for an indefinite period of time. While delegated, ATOM cannot be transferred as guaranteed by the protocol itself. However, you can trigger the process to unlock your staked ATOM by using the Wallet of your choice. This process is called "undelegating". The undelegate process take 21 days for ATOM to be transferrable again after the transaction to undelegate has been sent.
