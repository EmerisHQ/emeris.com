*The [Swap] section is located in the upper-right-hand corner of the [Portfolio] page.*

1. Select the token you want to swap
  *If you have this token in several chains, Emeris will ask you which one you want to use.*
  *If the tokens are not in the Cosmos Hub, Emeris will first perform an interchain transaction to bring the tokens into the hub and then add the tokens to the pool. You will need to [Confirm and continue] on Emeris first and then on Keplr to complete the transfer.*

2. Select the token you wish to obtain through this swap. You can get LP tokens as well.
  *Note that the tokens obtained from the exchange will be located in the Cosmos Hub.*

3. Write down either how many tokens you want to exchange or how many tokens you want to receive.

4. Click [**Review**]

5. Select [**Confirm and Continue**]

6. A popup of Keplr will now appear asking you to approve the operation by clicking [**Approve**].

7. Select [**Done**] on Emeris to complete.

Note:

* **Tokens obtained from the swap will be located in the Cosmos Hub**, if you want to move mainnet tokens to their chains, you must do so via interchain transaction.

* **Since the market is extremely volatile, the displayed value may change by the time you confirm your trade.** If you want to make sure that the amount of tokens you receive does not differ too much from expected, you can change the [Slippage] by clicking on the 3 dots at the top right of the [Swap] section. There you have 3 options: [0.1%] [0.5%] and [1%] which represent the percentage of tolerance you are willing to accept in completing the operation. If the system determines that it is impossible to execute the operation because the value of the tokens has changed, the operation will be canceled.

* **Don’t swap all the tokens you have**, there are fees to pay for doing so and if you don’t take this into account, your operation will fail.
