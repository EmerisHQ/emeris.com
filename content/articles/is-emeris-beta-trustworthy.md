Emeris is made by [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/about/), the core team that Founded Cosmos, which includes some of the best developers in the network. Knowing that, please be aware that this is a beta version, some of the functionalities will be limited or not yet implemented, and it is possible that you might experience localized disruptions or slow-responding functionality.

It's worthy to mention about Gravity DEX protocol as well, which is integrated in the most secure Proof of Stake blockchain to date and [passed several code audits](https://twitter.com/zcpeng/status/1412404404230164488?s=20).
