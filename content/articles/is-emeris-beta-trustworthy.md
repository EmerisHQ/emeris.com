Emeris is made by [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/about/), a core contributor to the Cosmos ecosystem with some of the best developers in the network. Furthermore, Emeris Beta is integrated with the Gravity DEX protocol, which is deployed on the most secure Proof of Stake blockchain to date and has [passed several code audits](https://twitter.com/zcpeng/status/1412404404230164488?s=20).

Despite this, please be aware that this is a beta version, which means that some of the functionalities will be limited or not yet implemented, and it is possible that you might experience localized disruptions or slow-responding functionality.
