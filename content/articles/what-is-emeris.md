Emeris is your portal to cross-chain DeFi (decentralized finance over multiple chains). The first of its kind, with Emeris, you can swap coins over different chains with affordable transaction fees, earn yield taking part in liquidity pools and other DeFi activities such as lending, yield farming, and staking, manage your crypto assets from one single interface, and easily transfer tokens from one chain to another.

Emeris will also provide a noncustodial wallet to allow you to remain in full control of your assets. Blockchain-agnostic, Emeris is designed to integrate with any DeFi protocol no matter which chain they operate on. The first application integrated at launch will be the Gravity DEX protocol on the Cosmos Hub.
