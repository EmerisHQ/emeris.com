There may be a lot of reasons why your transaction failed. Some common reasons are as follows:

- Your transaction fee was set too low, and while it may have been successful, Keplr wasnâ€™t able to verify the status of your transaction. Please make sure to check your address on a block explorer and wait 5-10 minutes before trying another transaction.
- You attempted to send/swap/add as liquidity a greater amount than your available balance (and/or not taking into account the transaction fee). Make sure that the total transaction + fees is less than your total available balance.
- Your coins may be all locked up as liquidity or staked, therefore not [Available] (or not enough) and therefore you are not able to cover the fees for any other transaction.
- There may have been a blocker in the interchain transfer you were going to operate: wait 10 minutes and if the operation was not successful and the funds are still not returned to the starting address, contact the support on telegram.
- Your Internet connection is not stable.
- There might be some problems associated with Keplr Wallet: make sure you are using the latest version via Google Chrome Desktop and proceed with a hard refresh if you see that the extension is struggling to update data.
