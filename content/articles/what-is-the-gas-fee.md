The transaction fee is a fee that goes to the validators of the network to process your transaction. Each validator sets the minimum fees it accepts between [Low] [Average] and [High].

In some networks where the prevalence of validators only accepts [Average] or [High], such as Secret Network & Akash Network, it is strongly suggested to avoid selecting [Low] as this may cause the operation to fail, and **transaction fees are not returned to the user**.

Depending on network conditions, you may need to increase your transaction fee to process your transaction faster.

Gravity DEX protocol/Emeris beta transaction fees will be between $0.01-$0.10, which will be paid in different tokens accordingly to the transaction and the location of the assets.

Emeris doesn't profit from the transaction fee.
