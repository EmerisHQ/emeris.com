APY stands for Annual Percentage Yield and is the rate of return you will earn for lending liquidity to a certain pool. You can calculate the APY like this:

Recent 1-hour fee income return rate * 24-hour * 365 days

(The return rate is calculated by the swap fee income divided by invested liquidity).
