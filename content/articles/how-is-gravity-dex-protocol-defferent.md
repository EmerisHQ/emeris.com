On top of the increasingly high fees associated with using an Ethereum-based DEX like Uniswap, slippage leads to inconsistencies in token prices. This is caused by the AMM model. Essentially, every time you conduct a swap price on Uniswap, it overshoots or undershoots. This creates huge arbitrage opportunities and price inconsistencies which are currently being exploited and can leave many traders on the wrong side of the spread. To address this issue, Gravity DEX replaces the AMM model with the Equivalent Swap Price Model (ESPM). It removes inefficient price discovery and slippage by landing on exactly the latest swap price making trading fairer and more efficient for all participants.

Gravity DEX further improves Uniswapâ€™s model by using batch execution to remove the possibility of front-running or price manipulation. On Uniswap, as orders are executed sequentially, skilled traders can pay more gas to ensure that their order goes through first. With batch execution, orders in the same block are processed at the same time and treated equally, meaning there are no opportunities for front-running.

Unlike Uniswap, Gravity DEX also has order book capability that enables the community to build order book trading UIs. This is an extremely useful instrument for traders as it provides instant and valuable market pricing information on all tokens being bought and sold. This allows traders to get a better idea of where the price may go in the near future based on the prices and volumes that people in the market are willing to buy and sell for.
