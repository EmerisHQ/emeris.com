The only wallet supported on Emeris Beta is the Keplr wallet, developed by Cosmos core contributing team Chainapsis. Keplr is officially supported only as a Chrome extension. Any other browser might cause severe disruption so it's not recommended that you use Keplr with any browser other than Chrome.
