title: Why did my available balance decrease even though my transaction failed?

Most standard transactions that fail do so because the fees you select are too low and do not cover the fees required by the chain or the validator that processes it.

However, the chain will recognize your transaction and treat the amount you input as a fee even if it is not enough to complete the transaction successfully.

We strongly recommend that you check the standard fees in each network to avoid incurring this.
