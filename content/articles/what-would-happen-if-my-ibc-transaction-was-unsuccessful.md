If it isn't correctly processed on the destination chain, then funds should be unlocked immediately.

If the transaction cannot be committed on the destination chain, you might have to wait up to 5 min (timeout) to see the funds unlocked.

If relayers are down, you might have to wait until their team restores the service.
