Since the market is extremely volatile, the displayed value may change by the time you confirm your trade. If you want to make sure that the amount of tokens you receive does not differ too much from expected, you can change the [Slippage] by clicking on the 3 dots at the top right of the [Swap] section.

There you have 3 options: [0.1%] [0.5%] and [1%] which represent the percentage of tolerance you are willing to accept in completing the operation. If the system determines that it is impossible to execute the operation because the value of the tokens has changed, the operation will be canceled.
