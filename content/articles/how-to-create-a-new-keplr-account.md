## How to create a new Account via Manemonic/Seed Phrase

* *If you are setting up Keplr for the first time:*
  In the initial pop-up window, choose [Create New Account]

* *If you have used Keplr before:*
  In the extension click on the silhouette in the upper-right-hand corner, then the blue box [Add Account] & select [Create New Account]

1. Choose to have a seed/mnemonic phrase of 24 words, then be sure to save them.
  *The safest way is to write the words on paper and store them in a secure place. Avoid taking screenshots of the words or copying them into your computer/phone notes.*

2. Now enter a name for your account (you can change it later).

3. You can change the derivation path by clicking on [**Advanced**], but this is optional and not suggested for how we are going to use Keplr.
  *If you are interested in knowing more about the HD wallet derivation path, you can find more in the [Keplr FAQ](https://faq.keplr.app), section [General Questions].*

4. Once you are sure that you have correctly transcribed the seed/mnemonic phrase, click on [**Next**].

5. To confirm the creation of the new account, all you have to do is click on the words in the right order in which they appear in your seed/mnemonic phrase and press [**Register**].

6. If you have just downloaded Keplr extension, it’s time to set your password! Choose carefully, if possible select a password you’re not using in any other application, and then click [**Confirm**].
  *If you have used Keplr before, this step will be skipped as you have already set your password when creating/importing your first account*

2. Now enter the email|phone number associated with your Google account, its password, and then click [**Next**].
