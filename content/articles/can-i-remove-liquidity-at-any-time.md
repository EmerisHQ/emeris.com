Yes: go to [pools] page, select the pool you want to remove the liquidity from, click on [Withdraw]. 

Now you can choose how much to withdraw (whether all or part of it) from the pool by using the LP tokens in your possession. For simplicity, at the bottom, you will find how much percentage of the pool corresponds to the tokens you want to withdraw.
