* *If you are setting up Keplr for the first time:*
  In the initial pop-up window, choose [**Import Ledger**]

* *If you have used Keplr before:*
  In the extension, click on the silhouette in the upper-right-hand corner, then the blue box [**Add Account]** & select [**Import Ledger**]

1. To complete the connection with your Ledger Nano Hard Wallet, follow the steps described in the pop-up that will appear ([you can find a detailed tutorial here](https://medium.com/chainapsis/how-to-use-ledger-nano-hardware-wallet-with-keplr-9ea7f07826c2)).

2. Make sure you have imported the account with the correct derivation path.
  *If you are interested in knowing more about the HD wallet derivation path, you can find more in the [Keplr FAQ](https://faq.keplr.app), section [General Questions].*

3. If you have just downloaded Keplr extension, it’s time to set your password! Choose carefully, if possible select a password you’re not using in any other application, and then click [**Confirm**].
  *If you have used Keplr before, this step will be skipped as you have already set your password when creating/importing your first account.*

4. Select [**Done**].
