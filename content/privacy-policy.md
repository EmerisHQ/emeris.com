If you do not agree to any term in this Policy, you should refrain from further use of our Services.

## 1. Information We Collect.

We receive several types of information about you from various sources, including automatically-collectedautomatically collected information described in detail below.

### 1.1 Information We Collect Automatically. 

We may use a variety of technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns whenever you interact with the Services, including:

1.  Activity Information. Details of your visits to our Services, including the types of content you view or engage with; the features you use; the actions you take; the people or accounts you interact with; the time, frequency, and duration of your activities; and other information about your use of and actions on the Services.
2.  Equipment Information. Information about your computer and internet connection, including your computer operating system, IP address, browser type, and browser language.

The gathering of this information may be used for maintaining the quality of the Services we provide, as well as providing overall general statistics related to the use of the Services. The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:

1.  Cookies. A cookie is a small data file stored on the hard drive of your computer either for only the duration of your visit on a website (“session cookies”) or for a fixed period (“persistent cookies”). Cookies contain information that can later be read by a web server. We may use cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on the Services.
2.  Web Beacons. Web beacons (also known as “clear gifs”, “pixel tags”, “web bugs”, and “single-pixel gifs”) are small files that are embedded in webpages, applications, and emails. Web beacons allow the Company, for example, to track who has visited those webpages or opened an email, test the effectiveness of our marketing, and compile other related website statistics.
3.  JavaScripts. JavaScripts are code snippets embedded in websites and applications that facilitate a variety of operations including accelerating the refresh speed of certain functionality or monitoring usage of various online components.
4.  Entity Tags. Entity Tags are HTTP code mechanisms that allow portions of websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser and validates these caches when the website is opened, accelerating website performance since the web server does not need to send a full response if the content has not changed.
5.  HTML5 Local Storage. HTML5 local storage allows data from websites to be stored or “cached” within your browser to store and retrieve data in HTML5 pages when the website is revisited.
6.  Resettable Device Identifiers. Resettable device identifiers (also known as “advertising identifiers”) are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (e.g., the “Identifier for Advertisers” or “IDFA” on Apple iOS devices and the “Google Advertising ID” on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.

This Policy does not cover the use of tracking technologies by third parties. The Services may contain links, content, advertising, or references to other websites by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use the Services.

If you have any questions about an ad or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly.

1.  Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. You may be able to set your browser to reject cookies and certain other technologies by adjusting the appropriate settings in your browser.

## 5. California Privacy Rights.

If you are a California resident, you have certain privacy rights under California law, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as the "Shine the Light" law) permits consumers who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the categories of personal information (as defined in the Shine the Light law), if any, that we disclosed in the preceding calendar year to third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Our disclosure requirements apply only if we share our consumers’ personal information with third parties for them to directly market their own products to those consumers, instead of assisting us with our own business. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, contact us as provided in the "Contact Us" section below.
