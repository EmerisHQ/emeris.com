# COSMOS Trademark Use Guidelines

## 1. Correct Use of Word Trademarks in Written Materials

This Policy covers our word trademark COSMOS; our logo shown below; and the unique visual styling of our website (our &quot;trade dress&quot;).

We encourage the proper use of our trademarks by the community where appropriate, but if a trademark is not used properly, it may gradually fail to identify the source of a specific good or service, ultimately becoming generic, or the trademark owner may be deemed to have abandoned its rights in the trademark. This Policy seeks to balance those concerns.

### 1.1 Universal Considerations

When you use any of our trademarks, you must not do so in a manner that will cause confusion. For example, your use of any of our trademarks must not suggest, either directly or through implication, that your product or website is an Interchain Foundation product or website, or that your product or website is sponsored or endorsed by The Interchain Foundation or the COSMOS development team.

Similarly, you may not use a trademark that is too similar to ours, such as an obvious variation of one of our marks or a website that imitates the visual styling of our website such that a viewer may be misled into believing it is associated with our website.

You may use our word marks to truthfully refer to the COSMOS™ network, following the guidelines below.

### 1.2 A Trademark Must Be Distinguished in Print

The Interchain Foundation&#39;s trademarks must always be distinguished in print from surrounding text. Unless a mark is a design or is comprised of stylized text, it should be graphically distinguished in any of the following manners:

1.  printing the mark in upper case letters — COSMOS
2.  printing the mark with initial caps — Cosmos
3.  printing the mark in quotation marks — &quot;Cosmos&quot;
4.  printing the mark in italics — _Cosmos_
5.  printing the mark in bold face type — **Cosmos**
6.  underlining the mark

Logos should consistently be used in the approved style and form. For example, the Cosmos logo should be used [in this style and form](https://cosmos.network/design):

### 1.3 A Trademark Must Be Used as an Adjective

Because trademarks are used to identify the specific source of goods or services, as opposed to a specific type of product or service, trademarks should always be used as adjectives. They should consistently be followed by a noun that is the generic name of the product identified by the mark, such as &quot;platform,&quot; &quot;blockchain,&quot; or &quot;software.&quot; The noun should not be capitalized or distinguished from surrounding text. Do **not** use the word &quot;Cosmos&quot; as the generic name of a product. A trademark should never be used as a verb.

#### Correct Usage

The COSMOS™ network of blockchains solves long-standing problems in cryptocurrency and blockchain communities.

The **Cosmos** ™ network can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can&#39;t do well.

This blockchain is in the Cosmos™ network.

#### Incorrect Usage

COSMOS™ is a network of blockchains whose purpose is to solve long-standing problems in cryptocurrency and blockchain communities.

**Cosmos™** can interoperate with multiple other applications and cryptocurrencies, something other blockchains can&#39;t do well.

### 1.4 Never Alter the Legibility, Spelling or Design of Any Trademark

In the case of a word trademark, always use the trademark in the singular form and never hyphenate the trademark. Spell the trademark correctly. The trademark should appear legibly, without alteration and in its complete form. Trademarks should not be abbreviated, spelled in an inconsistent manner, or used to coin new words. Finally, trademarks should never be made plural or used in the possessive form.

## 2. Correct Use of Trademark Designations

Two symbols are generally used in the United States to demonstrate a trademark owner&#39;s claims to rights in a trademark: ™ or ®. The ® symbol signifies that the mark has been registered in the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office (USPTO) or a state trademark office. When a mark is not registered in the United States, the ™ symbol should be used to designate that the term is a trademark. It is important to place these symbols directly after the trademark.

#### Correct Usage

Although it is not necessary to use a symbol every time a trademark is used in printed materials or on packaging or labels, a trademark symbol should be used at least once on the printed materials, packaging, or labels. For logos, the appropriate symbol should be locked with the logo so that it is used consistently each time the logo is used.

Additional factors need to be considered when identifying marks outside of the U.S. For instance, some countries do not recognize the ® symbol. In other countries, improper use of the ® symbol can result in forfeiture of trademark rights. Therefore, the ™ symbol, rather than the ® symbol, should be used directly after the mark for all products or materials that may be distributed outside of the United States.

If it is not feasible or aesthetically desirable to place the ® or ™ symbol with a mark, the mark can be followed by an asterisk (\*) that references a footnote similar in form to one of the following statements:

1.  Reg. U.S. Patent &amp; Trademark Office. (if applicable)
2.  This is a trademark of The Interchain Foundation in the United States and other countries.
3.  This is a registered trademark of The Interchain Foundation in the United States and other countries. (again, if applicable)

Alternatively, for labels, packaging, brochures, advertising or promotional materials intended for use in several countries, the following note could appear at the end of the document:

&quot;COSMOS is a trademark of The Interchain Foundation in the United States and other countries.&quot;

## 3. Use of Trade Names

The ™ and ® symbols should not be used with trade names, i.e., references to the company or to The Interchain Foundation. There is also no need to use distinguishing text (_e.g._, italics, underlining, etc.) when referring to the company itself.

#### Correct Usage

Watch presentations and other videos about and by the Tendermint team.

The Tendermint team has been contracted by the Interchain Foundation for development.

#### Incorrect Usage

The Tendermint™ team has been contracted by the Interchain Foundation for development.

Unlike trademarks, trade names can be used in the possessive. Thus, it is correct to say &quot;Tendermint&#39;s employees should all become familiar with these guidelines.&quot;
